This code is not open source or licenced out to anyone.
If you catch a glimpse of this code, no you didn't. Bad boy.
And if you just manage to blow up the world or do something else, I provide no warranty.
Besides, the first question I'd be asking you is who in the right ming managed to fuck up enough to give you access to this code.
